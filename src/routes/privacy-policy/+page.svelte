			This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is processed by Listen Later ("the
			application").
		</p>
		<p>It applies to usage of Listen Later on any device.</p>

		<h2 class="h2">Personal Information Collected by Listen Later</h2>
		<p>
			Listen Later collects information you provide to create your account and maintain your list.
			Depending on your chosen sign in method this may include (but is not limited to) your email
			address, name and profile picture. This information is collected to maintain your account,
			allowing sign in on different devices for access to your Listen Later list. This information
			is not shared with any third party. Listen Later may use your email address to contact you at
			a later date, for example if the application is being discontinued (as described in the
			<a href="/terms-of-use#termination-of-hosting" class="underline">Terms of Use</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
			Listen Later also collects information automatically when you use the application. This
			information includes (but is not limited to) your Internet Protocol address ('IP address'), a
			unique user identifier, and your device and browser type. This information is collected in
			order to protect the application from abuse, for example through the use of Google reCAPTCHA,
			and to support maintenance of the application, for example through application logs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Listen Later does not directly gather analytics or track usage data. The application is hosted
			using Google Firebase, which maintains some aggregated metrics such as the number of Monthly
			Active Users for billing purposes.

			Listen Later uses browser storage technologies (not including cookies) to support your usage
			of the application. This includes (but is not limited to) capturing your dark/light theme
			preference, maintaining your sign in session, and supporting usage of Google reCAPTCHA to
			protect the application from abuse (see above).

			Listen Later retains your information to support your usage of the application, until such a
			time as you request erasure.
